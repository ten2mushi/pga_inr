Playground for implicit neural representation using projective geometric algebra.

Observer-independent implicit neural representations using pga for coordinate free representations. The neural SDF is a continuous implicit function that represents the input shape.

## weight space manipulation

Example 02 shows weight-space translation, rotation, scaling and morphing
